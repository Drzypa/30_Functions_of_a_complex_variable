\begin{document}
Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$, and let $E$ be a subset of 
$\mathbb{C}_\infty=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ (the extended complex plane) which intersects every connected component of $\mathbb{C}_\infty-K$. If $f$ is an analytic function in an open set containing $K$, given $\varepsilon>0$, there is a rational function $R(z)$ whose only poles are in $E$, such that 
$|f(z)-R(z)|<\varepsilon$ for all $z\in K$.
