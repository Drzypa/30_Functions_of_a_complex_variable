From the fact that $1+x \leq e^{x}$ for $x \geq 0$ we get
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{n=1}^{m} a_n \leq \prod_{n=1}^{m} (1+a_n) \leq e^{\sum_{n=1}^{m} a_n}
\end{displaymath}
Since $a_n \geq 0$ both the partial sums and the partial products are monotone increasing with the number of terms. This concludes the proof.
