\begin{thm}[Mergelyan]
Let $K \subset {\mathbb{C}}$ be a compact subset of the complex plane such that
${\mathbb{C}} \backslash K$ (the complement of $K$) is connected, and let
$f\colon K \to {\mathbb{C}}$ be a continuous function which is also holomorphic
on the interior of $K.$  Then $f$ is the uniform limit on $K$ of holomorphic
polynomials (polynomials in one complex variable).
\end{thm}

So for any $\epsilon > 0$ one can find a polynomial $p(z) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j z^j$
such that $\lvert f(z) - p(z) \rvert < \epsilon$ for all $z \in K.$

Do note that this theorem is not a weaker version of Runge's theorem.  Here, we do not
need $f$ to be holomorphic on a neighbourhood of $K,$ but just on the interior of $K.$  For example, if the interior of $K$ is empty, then $f$ just needs to be continuous on $K.$  Further, it could be that the closure of the interior of $K$
might not be all of $K.$  Consider $K = D \cup [-10,10],$ where $D$
is the closed unit disc.  Then $K$ has two lines coming out of either end of the disc and $f$ needs to only be continuous there.

Also note that this theorem is distinct from the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.  The point here is that the polynomials are
holomorphic in Mergelyan's theorem.
