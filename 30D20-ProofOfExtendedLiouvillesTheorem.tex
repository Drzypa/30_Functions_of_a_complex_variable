This is a proof of the second, more general, form of Liouville's theorem given in the \PMlinkname{parent}{LiouvillesTheorem2} article.

Let $f:\Complex\to\Complex$ be a holomorphic function such that
$$|f(z)| < c \cdot |z|^n$$
for some $c\in\Reals$ and for $z\in\Complex$ with $|z|$ sufficiently large. Consider
$$g(z)=\begin{cases}\frac{f(z)-f(0)}{z}&z\neq 0\\
f'(0)&z=0
\end{cases}
$$
Since $f$ is holomorphic, $g$ is as well, and by the bound on $f$, we have
\[|g(z)|< c_1 + c_2 \cdot |z|^{n-1} < c'\cdot |z|^{n-1}\]
again for $|z|$ sufficiently large.

By induction, $g$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$, and thus $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$.
