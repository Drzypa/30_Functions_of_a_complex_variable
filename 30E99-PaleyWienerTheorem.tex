\begin{document}
Let $f(z)$ be an entire function such that $\vert f(z)\vert \leq K
e^{\gamma \vert z\vert}$ for some $K \geq 0$ and
$\gamma > 0$. If the restriction of $f$ to the real line
is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, then there exists a function  
$g(t)\in L^2(-\gamma, \gamma)$ such that
$$ f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\gamma}^{\gamma}g(t)e^{izt}dt$$
for all $z$.
