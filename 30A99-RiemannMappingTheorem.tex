\begin{document}
Let $U$ be a simply connected open proper subset of $\mathbb{C}$, and let
$a\in U$. There is a unique analytic function $f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$
such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(a)=0$, and $f'(a)$ is real and positive;
\item $f$ is injective;
\item $f(U)=\{z\in \mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Remark.} As a consequence of this theorem, any two simply connected regions, none of which is the whole plane, are conformally equivalent.
