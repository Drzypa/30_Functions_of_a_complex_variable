\begin{defn}
Suppose that ${\mathbb{C}}$ is the complex plane and $G \subset {\mathbb{C}}$.  The {\em extended boundary} of $G$ denoted $\partial_\infty G$ is defined as
the boundary of $G$ plus the point at infinity if in fact $G$ is unbounded.
\end{defn}

The extended boundary of $G$ is really the boundary of $G$ 
in the extended complex plane (the one-point
compactification of ${\mathbb{C}}$).
