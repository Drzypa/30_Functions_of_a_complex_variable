\begin{document}
Let the complex function $f(z)$ be holomorphic in a deleted neighbourhood of the point\, $z = z_0$\, of the closed complex plane
$\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$.\, This point is
\begin{itemize}
\item a regular point (or a removable singularity) iff $f(z)$ is bounded in a neighbourhood of $z_0$,
\item a pole iff\; $\displaystyle\lim_{z \to z_0}|f(z)| \,=\, +\infty$,
\item an essential singularity iff there is neither of the above cases.
\end{itemize}
