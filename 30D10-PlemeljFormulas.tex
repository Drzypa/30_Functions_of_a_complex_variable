Let $\psi(\zeta)$ be a density function of a complex variable satisfying the H\"older condition (the Lipschitz condition of order $\alpha$){\footnote{A function $f(\zeta)$ satisfies the H\"older condition on a smooth curve $C$ if for every $\zeta_1,\zeta_2\in C$ $|f(\zeta_2)-f(\zeta_1)|\leq M|\zeta_2-\zeta_1|^\alpha$, $M>0$, $0<\alpha\leq 1$. It is clear that the H\"older condition is a weaker restriction than a bounded derivative for $f(\zeta)$.}} on a smooth closed contour $C$ in the integral
\begin{align}
\Psi(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta,
\end{align}
then the limits $\Psi^+(t)$ and $\Psi^-(t)$ as $z$ approaches an arbitrary point $t$ on $C$ from the interior and the exterior of $C$, respectively, are
\begin{align}
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\Psi^+(t) \equiv \frac{1}{2}\psi(t)+
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-t}d\zeta, \\ 
\Psi^-(t) \equiv -\frac{1}{2}\psi(t)+
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-t}d\zeta.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align}
These are the Plemelj\cite{cite:Plemelj} formulas {\footnote{cf.\cite{cite:Musk}, where restrictions that Plemelj made, were relaxed.}}  and the improper integrals in (2) must be interpreted as Cauchy's principal values.
