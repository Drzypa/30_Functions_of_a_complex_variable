The following is a list of fundamental theorems in the subject of complex analysis (single complex variable).  If a theorem does not yet appear in the encyclopedia, please consider adding it --- Planet Math is a work in progress and \PMlinkescapetext{even} some basic results have not yet been entered.  Likewise, if some basic theorem has been overlooked in this list, please add it.
