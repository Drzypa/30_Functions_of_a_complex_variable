\begin{document}
Consider the sequence of partial sums $s_n=\sum_{m=1}^n f_m$.
Take any $p,q\in\N$ such that $p\le q$,then, for every $x\in X$, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
	|s_q(x)-s_p(x)| &=& \left|\sum_{m=p+1}^q f_m(x)\right| \\
		&\le& \sum_{m=p+1}^q |f_m(x)| \\
		&\le& \sum_{m=p+1}^q M_m
\end{eqnarray*}
But since $\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n$ converges, for any $\eps>0$ we can
find an $N\in\N$ such that, for any $p,q>N$ and $x\in X$, we have
$|s_q(x)-s_p(x)|\le\sum_{m=p+1}^q M_m<\eps$. Hence the sequence
$s_n$ converges uniformly to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$.
